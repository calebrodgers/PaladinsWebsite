Twenty twenty. I don’t think anyone could have predicted the wild rollercoaster of a year that we were in for. While some moments shook the entire FIRST community, we wouldn’t have had our rookie year any different. For starters, the Paladins of St Paul’s were formed. From nothing. A wonderful group of like-minded people who all shared an interest in technology and robotics got together for the first time and subsequently built a team. Relationships where formed, even in the shorter season time and everyone had a blast. As well as all of this, we not only learnt about all of *FIRST*’s programs and the meaning behind them all, we learned what it means to be true *Gracious Professionals* and have been excited to dive deeper into engineering in the future. We can’t wait for what next year brings and are excited to meet more and more teams (hopefully in person!). Bring on 2021!
