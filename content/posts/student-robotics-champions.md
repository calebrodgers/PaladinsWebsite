Yesterday marked the end of a virtual robotics programming competition that spanned five months. The global [Student Robotics](https://www.studentrobotics.org/) competition headquartered in London, saw teams from around the world compete in a virtual league, with four matches of increasing complexity, building up to the knockout rounds and grand final that was held last night. The Paladins of St Paul's were extremely proud to represent Australia, while competing alongside teams from the UK, France, Germany, Malaysia and Indonesia. The competition sees us given a (virtual) robot to compete in the 2021 game, _Radars of the Lost Ark_, where teams have to claim (and steal!) towers from each other, all by writing and submitting code - which will then be simulated against other team's robot code, along with exciting commentary from the brilliant team at Student Robotics!

> **_The Paladins made it all the way to the knockouts, where we proceeded to win every match that we were put in, securing us a place in the grand final where we were put up against the brilliant team HRS3 from Hills Road Sixth Form College in London. However, it was our precise robot control and bold strategy that saw us win 36-8, earning us the title of world champions!_**

Recognition must be given to everyone on the team who contributed to the project, to our fantastic coach, Mrs O'Malley, and to the volunteers at Student Robotics, who made the competition fun - and were always online to help with any questions (and deal with our "fun-posting" shenanigans)! A special mention, however, must be given to our incredible mentor Shaun, who put so much in and always inspired us with his brilliant ideas üòé.

# üì∫ You can watch us compete in the videos below!
